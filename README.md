# Calculator
 This is a simple calculator with simple funtions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
 I have used the tkinter library to make a GUI for the calculator, so that is the main highlight of this project

Fork the project using `git clone https://github.com/Suhel-Kap/Calculator.git` and run the `calc.py` file to run the calculator
